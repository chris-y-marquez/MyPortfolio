      <h2> About Chris </h2>
      <p>The first time I started coding, it was like things finally made sense in a way. Now I am determined to learn as much as I can about the complex world of coding</p>

      <p>Outside of coding, many of my interests lie in coffee. I am someone who likes to experiment with different and new coffee beans and flavors. Here is a link to one of my favorite coffee companies to try : <a href = "https://www.hawaiicoffeecompany.com"> Hawaii Coffee Company</a> </p> <!-- a link to a outside website -->
